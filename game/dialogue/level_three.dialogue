Dr Whatever: Hello!
Dr Whatever: My name is Doctor Whatever.
Dr Whatever: It's nice to see you, Smart Scanner.
Dr Whatever: I have been told that Dr. Rensselaer updated your code, so now you can actually help me with patient diagnosis.
Dr Whatever: Computer area is not my area of expertise, but I believe the word that they used was... reinforcement learning?
Dr Whatever: That sounds quite difficult, but hopefully I will see the effects in practice.
Dr Whatever: Speaking of practice, we have a patient who's about to come in with a complaint.
Dr Whatever: Let's see if I can use some of your help to determine their medication.
